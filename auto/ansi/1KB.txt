Analysing algorithms involves thinking about how their resource requirements-the amount of time and space they use-will scale with increasing input size. We begin this chapter by talking about how to put this notion on a concrete footing, as making it concrete opens the door to a rich understanding of computational tractability. Having done this, we develop the mathematical machinery needed to talk about the way in which different functions scale with increasing input size, making precise what it means for one function to grow faster than another.
We then develop running-time bounds for some basic algorithms, beginning with an implementation of the Gale-Shapley algorithm from Chapter 1 and continuing to a survey of many different running times and certain characteristic types of algorithms that achieve these running times. In some cases, obtaining a good running-time bound relies on the use of more sophisticated data structures, and we conclude this chapter with a very useful example of such a data structure: priority queues and their implementation using heaps.
